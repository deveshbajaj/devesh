would like to see a first draft of a template by Tuesday next week.

 

My thoughts on what the report should have:

 

-          Users

o   Total registered users

o   Unique per day for last week

o   Active cumulative over last week

o   New users added in last week

o   Profile of active users – circle, NHQ, network, business etc.

 

-          Size of platform

o   Number of servers – types of nodes and counts etc.

o   Number of VMs etc.

 

-          Utilization statistics

o   Memory utilization (hourly trend if relevant or max during the day for last week)

o   Drop wizard threads etc.

 

-          Job statistics

o   Total daily jobs

§  Successful/unsuccessful

o   Total weekly jobs

§  Successful/unsuccessful

 

-          Platform Availability

o   % availability for last week

o   Number of Sev1, Sev2 incidents…MTTR for those incidents

 

-          Data availability

o   Out of the 40 or more ingestion sources, what % of total data was ingested last week successfully

 

-          Open defects

o   Total open as on date

o   Closed last week – some trends for last week

 

-          Application statistics

o   Module usage stats

§  Which report gets downloaded the most?

§  How many total reports are generated/downloaded per day, and cumulative for last week

§  How many WOs got executed through JCP in last week

§  Which module gets used the most – do we have stats on clicks etc. by module

 

o   Module performance

§  Time taken to generate/download a report

 

-          We then get to requirements

§  What got delivered last week – fixes, new requirements

§  What is the plan for next 30 days
